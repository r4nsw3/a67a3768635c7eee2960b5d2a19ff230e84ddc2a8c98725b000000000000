  |   The Mysterious Painting the twins have discovered was definitely      |
  |   not the only one. Further more, it is not always as simple as just    |
  |   finding them. Sometimes the Painting they wish to explore will        |
  |   require a Restoration, and sometimes they will need to find some      |
  |   specific items to be able to perform it.                              |
  |   Lydie and Suelle will have to do their best, and sometimes rely on    |
  |   the help from their friends, to learn how to synthesize the           |
  |   required items.                                                       |
